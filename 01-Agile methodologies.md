# Agile methodologies

It might sound suprising to a lot of people that the popular productivity method Agile isn't just a single method but a combination of multiple different methods. Agile contains methodologies like Lean, XP, and Scrum, from which the name Scrum master and product owner come from.

The daily and weekly sprints in Agile are also from the Scrum methodology. Scrum is often used as the base or foundation for Agile methodologies.

Agile also takes bits and pieces from Lean, test-driven, and Extreme programming (XP) and creates a solution that works best for the team and company. DevOps and release on demand are also examples of different Agile methods.
